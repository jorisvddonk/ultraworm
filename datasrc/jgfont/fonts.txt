speech.jgfont doesn't seem to be used anywhere. Not even for speech. :)
tinyfont.jgfont is 95% of all the game's text (regular font)
smallfont.jgfont is the bigger fonts you see in the game, such as all the numbers on the campaign screen, and the Titan names on the Titan description pages.
bigfont.jgfont is the "EXTREME DANGER" text, plus some other texts such as "GAME PAUSED" when you hit escape in-game.
